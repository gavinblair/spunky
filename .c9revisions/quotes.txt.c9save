matter what, you mustn't win.\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,520\r\nYou'll torment the Japanese wrestler,\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,160\r\nbut in the end, the people want

weapons\r\nand terrorism,\r\n\r\n398\r\n00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,990\r\nand all the chaos in today's society\r\ncan be embodied by Calamari.\r\n\r\n399\r\n00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,230\r\nBy showing our own ace\r\ndefeating that giant squid,\r\n\r\n400\r\n00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,140\r\nwe can help alleviate\r\nthe people's anxiety.\r\n\r\n401\r\n00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,800\r\nIt's a cause worth working for.\r\n\r\n402\r\n00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,710\r\nI'll see to it that\r\npro wrestling will blossom\r\n\r\n403\r\n00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,510\r\ninto the king of popular culture,\r\nlike it was during Godozan's time.\r\n\r\n404\r\n00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,810\r\nGodozan wouldn't have wanted\r\nthat brand of pro wrestling.\r\n\r\n405\r\n00:35:36,420 -->
