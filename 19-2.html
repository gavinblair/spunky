    <p class='title'>&gt; hack the puppies</p>
    <p>
		You have been working on the <strong>STUFFED PUPPIES project</strong> for some time now. They are meant to be <strong>BABY TOYS</strong> 
        but you have gotten pretty good at getting them to do things that they weren't originally programmed for.
	</p>
    <p>
        You choose one that you just happen to know is named <strong>Sunflower</strong>.
        It is worth mentioning at this point that you are interested in these <strong>puppies</strong> purely because they are a 
        <strong>challenge to hack</strong>,
        and not because they are <strong>cuddly little fuzzy bundles of joy</strong>. Because they aren't.
    </p>
    <p>
        You pick up <strong>Sunflower</strong> from the floor and give it a squeeze. 
        <kbd style="color: yellow; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #000">"I love you, Mitch!"</kbd>
        Shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have been able to <strong>ADD</strong> things to a puppy's script, but you have been unable to <strong>remove</strong> what it was originally programmed to say.

        <kbd style="color: yellow; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #000"><a style="color: yellow;" href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNU0Ur8rzNw' target='_blank'>"They've provoked him! It's a raging squid!"</a></kbd> That's better.
