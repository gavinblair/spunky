		You have been working on the <strong>STUFFED PUPPIES project</strong> for some time now. They are meant to be <strong>BABY TOYS</strong> 
        but you have gotten pretty good at getting them to do things that they weren't originally programmed for.
	</p>
    <p class='lengthy'>
        You choose one that you just happen to know is named <strong>Sunflower</strong>.
        It is worth mentioning at this point that you are interested in these <strong>puppies</strong> purely because they are a 
        <strong>challenge to hack</strong>,
        and not because they are <strong>cuddly little fuzzy bundles of joy</strong>. Because they aren't.
