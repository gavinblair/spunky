Following are the details of a project to create a completely
autonomous "second layer" of the Internet, completely free of the
influence of or need for Internet Service Providers, and untouchable
by the government. This plan is named after Leonard Kleinrock,
inventor of the Internet Packet. It has been enacted after news of a
bill entering the United States Senate which would allow a President
to disable all Internet connectivity within the United States. (We
later heard that this bill doesn't do quite that, but that the
President has had the power to shut down any telecommunications
network (as defined by the FCC) for over 70 years.)
